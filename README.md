This class was held in 2022 by Dr. John Paul Ward from North Carolina A&T State University. 
This was my first introduction to using Python, so if there is an issue with one of my codes please feel 
I used Anaconda's Spyder throughout this class.
free to comment or get in contact with me with a fix, Thank you!
The code that has "week" at the beginning was the lesson for the week. 
The code that has "math140_Payton" is my work from the lessons.
There are many NPY-type files but this was used in my work related to m and p numbers. 
Other files are rather data points that we used or files that were being worked on and were named differently.
