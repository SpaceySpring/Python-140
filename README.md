This class was held in 2022 by Dr. John Paul Ward from North Carolina A&T State University. 
This was my first introduction into using python so if there is an issue with one of my code please feel 
free to comment or get in contact with me with a fix, Thank you!
Code that has "week" at the begenning was the lesson for the week. 
Code that has "math140_Payton" is my work from the lessons.
There are many NPY type files but this was used in my work related to m and p numbers. 
Other files are rather data points that we used or files that was being worked on and was named differently.
